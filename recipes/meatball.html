    <h2>Turkey and rice meatball meal</h2>
    <p>As these turkey and rice meatballs simmer in the sauce,
       the rice absorbs moisture, swell ups, and creates a relatively tender, moist meatball.
       I didn't intend this recipe to be a Thanksgiving dinner alternative, but now that I think about it, 
       these could actually work. These are delicious served over saffron basmati rice.

        <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano </li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
        <li>2½ cups prepared tomato sauce </li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth, plus more as needed </li>
        <li>⅓ cup creme fraiche </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Preparation steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and oil the surface lightly.</li>
        <li>Mix ground turkey, cooked rice, garlic, parsley, egg, salt, paprika, cumin, pepper, oregano, 
            cayenne, and olive together in a bowl using a fork. 
            Portion mixture with a small scoop (between 1/4 and 1/3 cup) and place on prepared foil-lined baking sheet.
            Use your (wet) hands to form into round meatballs. Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour chicken broth and prepared tomato sauce in a saucepan. Whisk in creme fraiche, sherry vinegar, and paprika.
            Transfer meatballs to tomato sauce. Set heat to medium high and bring to a simmer. 
            Reduce heat to low and simmer until tender, 60 to 90 minutes. If sauce gets too thick, add a splash or 2 of broth or water.
            Remove from heat. Stir in parsley, salt, and pepper.
        </li>
     </ol>
