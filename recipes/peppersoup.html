             For the Spice Mix: In a small stainless-steel or cast iron skillet, 
             combine urheri, erhe, gbafilo, umilo, alligator pepper, and uziza. 
             Over medium-low heat, toast spices, stirring and swirling frequently, until fragrant, about 5 minutes. 
             Let cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. 
             Transfer spices to a spice grinder and grind until a crumbly, coarse powder forms, 2 to 3 minutes. 
             Empty into a small bowl; set aside.

              For the Pepper Soup: In a large stockpot, combine chicken, water, ground crayfish, salt, cayenne pepper, 
              half of the lemongrass, and prepared spice mix. Bring to a boil over high heat, 
              then reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Simmer until chicken is cooked through and tender, 
              but not falling off the bone, about 45 minutes (the time may vary depending on how the meat was cut).
        </li>
        <li>
            Add lime leaves and remaining lemongrass. Season with salt and cayenne pepper to taste.
             Let stand to allow flavors to develop, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            To serve, divide chicken between warmed soup bowls.
             Ladle broth on top, garnish with scent leaf, and serve with or alongside boiled yams, plantains, 
             white sweet potatoes, or rice, and a small bowl of palm oil for dipping.
